# Delivery Self Guided Trial

Welcome to the Delivery Self Guided Trial

Delivery Trials are currently invite only. If you've stumbled here on
your own, please request an [INVITE](https://www.chef.io/delivery/) or 
speak with your Chef account representative.

These docs will provide you with instructions for accessing your trial
environment, and guide you through pushing changes through the delivery
pipeline. Accessing the environment will require internet access, a web browser, as well as an SSH client.

## Components
* Workstation Server
    - This machine serves as your working environment for checking out projects from Chef Delivery and pushing changes through the pipeline.
* Delivery Server
    - Where the magic happens! This is your target for cloning repositories,
    pushing changes, and has a web-accessible UI.
* Chef Server
    - You will have UI access to the Chef Server to inspect policy and node state
    as well as track the reporting output for your changes.
* Delivery Infrastructure
    - Build Nodes
        - Not accessible via SSH or Web, but these are the machines your delivery jobs will run from.
    - Each deployable stage of delivery has its own web-accessible server you can use to validate changes you push through the pipeline. Servers are as follows:
        - Acceptance
        - Union
        - Rehearsal
        - Delivered
